In the following, the app _Startup Ideas_ will get introduced. 

## Description of the application idea and purpose
This app is designed to allow its users to store startup ideas in order to reduce their mental load. This way, as soon as they think of a new idea, they can 'dump' it directly into the app. They can also get a quick overview of how many ideas they have already finished, are currently working on, and still want to do, as well as how high their personal priority is for each idea.
